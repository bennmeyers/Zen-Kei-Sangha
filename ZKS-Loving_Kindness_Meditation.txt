May All Beings Be Happy
May we be joyous and live in peace and safety.
All living beings whether weak or strong,
In high or middle or low realms of existence.
Small or great, visible or invisible,
Near or far, born or to be born,
May All Beings be Happy.

Let no one deceive another,
Nor despise any being in any state
Let none by anger or hatred wish harm to another.

Even as a parent at the risk of their life,
Watches over and protects their only child,
So with a boundless heart,
Shall we cherish all living things
Suffusing love over the entire world,
Above, below, and all around without limit.
So shall we cultivate an infinite good will
Towards the whole world.

During all our waking hours
May we spread joy and live in peace and safety.
May All Beings Be Happy.
